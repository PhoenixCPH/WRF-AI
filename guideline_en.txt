In your current folder, the content of the file 'extracted_wrfout_variable.txt' is the result of the command 'ncdump -h wrfout_d01_2015-03-01_00:00:00 2>&1 > extracted_wrfout_variable.txt'. This file contains the variable information of the wrfout file.

The file 'wrfout_d01_2015-03-01_00:00:00' is a NetCDF file output by the WRF-Chem model.

Currently, the NetCDF files already output by WRF-Chem are as follows:

These files are all NetCDF files output by the WRF-Chem model, containing information on variables such as meteorology, chemistry, and radiation.

The work you need to do now is:
Based on these existing wrfout files as a dataset, train a diffusion model that can predict and output the next wrfout file based on the previous input wrfout file. Both input and output variables are variables within the wrfout file.
Since the wrfout files contain information on variables such as meteorology, chemistry, and radiation, you need to consider the influence of these variables and build a diffusion model capable of handling these variables.
You need to use the Python language and use PyTorch and related libraries to complete this task, and optimize the training for NVIDIA A800 GPUs.
Each wrfout file includes 720 time frames, with each time frame corresponding to 1 minute of data. As you can see, the wrfout files are generated every 12 hours.
At the same time, there is also a file named 'namelist.input' in current folder for your reference, which is the configuration file when running WRF-Chem, controlling how the WRF-Chem runs.

Since each wrfout file is very large, with the total data volume reaching up to 14TB, please adopt more efficient methods for data preprocessing. At the same time, use more efficient methods for model training.
For the data preprocessing stage, if GPU can be used to assist in data preprocessing, please use GPU for data preprocessing as much as possible.
Make full use of NVIDIA A800 GPUs for training to ensure that GPU resources are fully utilized.

Have a comprehensive error handling mechanism, and if you encounter code errors, please report the complete information.
The code you write needs to be compatible with Python 3.11.12 and CUDA version 11.8.
Please also export the complete Python package information required for running.
